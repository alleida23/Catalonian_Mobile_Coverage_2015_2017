**Project Overview:**

This project aims to create a comprehensive dataset using data from the public Google BigQuery dataset "[mobile_data_2015_2017](link)." The project involves creating and utilizing a BigQuery connection to extract, clean, and update the dataset using SQL queries.

Key project components include:

- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is meticulously cleaned through SQL operations, including creating, updating, altering, and deleting columns and rows. This step ensures that the data is in an optimal state for analysis.

- **Table Creation:** Two new tables are generated from scratch, enabling the practice of join operations and further enhancing SQL skills.

- **SQL Practice:** The primary objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience with SQL commands. Special attention is given to aggregated functions, join operations, window functions, and the creation of views.

Please note that this project is an ongoing endeavor, with continuous development and enhancements.
